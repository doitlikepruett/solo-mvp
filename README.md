There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
 Google Suggestion Guesser Game

## Sub-Heading ##
  The google suggestion game you can play alone or with friends!

## Summary ##
  When inputting text into google, it pops up with autocomplete suggestions for what it thinks you want to search for. With the Google Suggestion Guesser Game, you type in the first few words of your search, and try to guess what the top google suggestion is. Points are awarded based on the rank of your guess from the suggestions; if you guess the top suggestion, you get 10 points, and one less for each of the 10 suggestions going down the list. 

## Problem ##
  Usually, you have to play this game with one person picking the questions and everyone else guessing. 

## Solution ##
  With the Google Suggestion Guesser Game, everyone can participate, and you can even play alone without seeing the answers! By grabbing and masking the results, then comparing them to your guess, you can guess up to 10 different suggestions. Normally you can only see three when interacting with Google directly.
